This Folder holds files that work on motion control. Path generation, and motion profile generation.
Most of the files are aimed toward path planning.







1. Generate Waypoints
Define the key points you want your robot to pass through. These could be manually defined or generated via an optimization algorithm like RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Trees) or A* for obstacle avoidance and finding efficient paths.
These waypoints represent the general trajectory your robot needs to follow to reach its destination.
2. Optimize Path with Algorithms (e.g., RRT)
Use an optimization algorithm like RRT or A* to plan a rough path that avoids obstacles and finds an efficient route from the start to the destination.
RRT can be especially useful for complex environments where obstacle avoidance is crucial.
Here's an example of how RRT might generate waypoints:

java
Copy code
// Use RRT or A* to find optimal waypoints, assuming this function is pre-built
List<Point> waypoints = rrtOptimization(startPoint, endPoint, obstacles);
3. Spline Interpolation for Smooth Curves
After getting the waypoints from the RRT algorithm, use splines (e.g., Catmull-Rom, Hermite, or B-splines) to smoothly interpolate between these waypoints.
Control the curviness by adjusting tangents or tension to ensure smooth transitions without sharp turns.
Example of using a Catmull-Rom Spline for smooth interpolation:

java
Copy code
// Assume points and tangents generated based on waypoints
double[][] interpolatedPath = interpolatePoints2D(waypoints, tangents, resolution);
4. Generate a Motion Profile
With the smooth spline path generated, you now need to apply a motion profile to control the robot's speed, acceleration, and jerk along the path.
Use a trapezoidal or S-curve motion profile to ensure the robot accelerates and decelerates smoothly while respecting its physical constraints (like maximum speed and acceleration).
Example using a trapezoidal profile:

java
Copy code
MotionProfile profile = new TrapezoidalProfile(maxSpeed, maxAcceleration);
for (double[] point : interpolatedPath) {
    profile.addPoint(point);
}
5. Save Path as Inputs for PID Control
Once the motion profile is applied, store the path in a table (array) that holds position, velocity, and acceleration at each point in time.
These will serve as the setpoints for your PID controller, which will track the robot's actual movement against these setpoints in real-time.
Example of storing the motion profile in a table:

java
Copy code
List<PathPoint> motionTable = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < profile.getLength(); i++) {
    motionTable.add(new PathPoint(profile.getPosition(i), profile.getVelocity(i), profile.getAcceleration(i)));
}
6. Integrate Real-Time Error Compensation
Implement a PID controller that adjusts the robot's behavior in real-time based on feedback from sensors (e.g., encoders, gyros).
This controller compares the robot’s actual position and velocity to the desired values from the motion table and applies corrections accordingly.
You can also add feedforward terms if necessary to compensate for system dynamics.
Example of PID control with real-time feedback:

java
Copy code
// Example PID controller
PIDController positionPID = new PIDController(kP, kI, kD);
PIDController velocityPID = new PIDController(vP, vI, vD);

for (int i = 0; i < motionTable.size(); i++) {
    PathPoint target = motionTable.get(i);

    // Get real-time feedback (position, velocit) from sensors
    double actualPosition = getCurrentPosition();
    double actualVelocity = getCurrentVelocity();

    // Calculate errors
    double positionError = target.getPosition() - actualPosition;
    double velocityError = target.getVelocity() - actualVelocity;

    // Compute control signals
    double positionCorrection = positionPID.calculate(positionError);
    double velocityCorrection = velocityPID.calculate(velocityError);

    // Apply corrections to motors
    applyMotorPower(positionCorrection + velocityCorrection);
}
Summary of the Steps:
Define waypoints manually or generate them using optimization algorithms (like RRT or A*).
Interpolate the waypoints with a spline algorithm (like Catmull-Rom or Hermite), adjusting curviness to ensure smooth transitions.
Apply a motion profile (trapezoidal or S-curve) to limit speed and acceleration along the path.
Store the path in a table of position, velocity, and acceleration for use in control loops.
Implement a PID control loop that uses feedback from sensors to adjust real-time performance and keep the robot on track.
By following these steps, you’ll have a complete system for path planning and execution, ensuring smooth, efficient motion while considering physical limits and real-time corrections.
